# Behavioral Science Portfolio
 
This is a repository of the side projects I worked on or currently working on. It is updated regularly. The projects are either written in R, Python, STATA, or Eviews. The goal of the projects is to uncover interesting behavioral economics and data science/statistical modelling answers. A typical project consist of conducting experiments, finding and cleaning data, analysis, visualization, and conclusion. Click on the projects to see snippets of analysis and code.
 
## Projects:
 

### [Behavioral Economic Experiments](https://behavioral-science.herokuapp.com)
* Demonstration of behavioral economic experiments, game theory, and other economic games using oTree.
* Programmed in Python and oTree; environment in Heroku and PostgresSQL; analysis in R and STATA.
