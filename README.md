# Behavioral Science Portfolio
 
This is a repository of the projects I worked on or currently working on. It is updated regularly. The projects are either written in R (R markdown) or Python (Jupyter Notebook). The goal of the projects is to use data science/statistical modelling techniques to find something that is interesting. A typical project consist of finding and cleaning data, analysis, visualization and conclusion. Click on the projects to see full analysis and code.

###  [Exchange Rate Analysis During US Election - Under Construction](https://github.com/alexhuang1117/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/FX_Analysis_During_US_Election/main.ipynb)
* Predicted US (2016) election victories as the voting results of each region becomes available.
* Regressed states with results against polling data and predicted results for the remaining states
* Monte Carlos simulation used to simulate the winner of the election.
* Compared simulated results with exchange rates fluctuations to see if market is efficient.
* **Keywords**(Python, Linear Regression, Monte Carlos Simulation)
